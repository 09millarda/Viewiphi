# Viewiphi
Design and buy your very own custom iPhone using an awesome 3D design tool for complete control.

Due to this being a private company's product, I am obviously not allowed to release the source code for the project...

...I am however allowed to write about it and add it to my GitHub page :)

I was hired to design and create (along with a few people off of upwork) Viewiphi (https://www.viewiphi.com/). What can I say? I learned a lot, it was hard work but also extremely enjoybale and rewarding. Plus, it works well!

If you are reading this, you are likely an employer that wants to see what I can do. Here is a basic breakdown of how the website functions and what I used to make it:

Server-side: PHP. Handles pretty much everything really. All requests, communicates with the database in order to present up-to-date information to customers.

Client-side: HTML, CSS and Javascript (obviously) along with JQuery for easy AJAX request support. No frameworks.

Database: Firebase. Live updates, JSON data structures along with a cheap PAYG billing system with automated management and backups. A great system for this project.

PLUS: Node JS, it tracks where the order requests are at and manages/deletes them accordingly to some preset parameters.
      Electron, for the desktop data management system. The admins can change the colours and stock numbers of everything using this and also tracks and manages the process of actually creating the phone.
